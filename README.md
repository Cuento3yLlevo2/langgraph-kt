**AI agents and workflows for Kotlin, as small typed graphs.** You write each step as a `suspend`
function on a `data class` of your own, and connect the steps with arrows. Telar runs the graph on
every Kotlin platform, from a server to Android, iOS and the browser, and takes care of loops,
parallel steps, live streaming, save points, and pausing until a person approves.

**[Try it in your browser](https://deeptelar.github.io/telar-demo/):** Pixel Pizza is a
small game in which every stage runs a Telar graph, from two nodes in a row to a full agent
workflow. No account and no API key needed.

## An agent in a few lines

A model that calls your functions until it can answer. `toolAgent` is that loop, ready-made:

```kotlin
import dev.deeptelar.telar.agent.*
import dev.deeptelar.telar.anthropic.AnthropicChatModel
import io.ktor.client.HttpClient
import kotlinx.serialization.Serializable

@Serializable
data class City(@Description("A city, for example \"Lisbon\"") val name: String)

// A tool: a function the model may call. Its input class becomes the schema the model reads.
val weather = Tool<City>("weather", "Returns today's weather in a city.") { city ->
    "Light rain and 17 °C in ${city.name}." // call your real service here
}

suspend fun main() {
    val model = AnthropicChatModel(HttpClient(), apiKey = System.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"), model = "claude-opus-5-5")
    val agent = toolAgent(model, tools = listOf(weather), system = "You are a travel assistant.")

    // The agent is a graph like any other: stream it, save it, pause it before a tool runs.
    agent.stream(AgentState("Do I need an umbrella in Lisbon today?")).collect { event ->
        event.textDelta?.let { print(it) } // the answer, piece by piece
    }
}
```

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts. `@Serializable` needs the plugin kotlin("plugin.serialization").
implementation("dev.deeptelar:telar-agent:0.1.0-alpha09")
implementation("dev.deeptelar:telar-anthropic:0.1.0-alpha09") // or telar-openai: OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Groq, ...
implementation("io.ktor:ktor-client-cio:3.6.0")                // any Ktor engine
```

The same agent with OpenAI, Gemini or a local Ollama model, a person who approves each tool call,
and a chat that continues across turns: [Agents with tools](https://deeptelar.github.io/telar/guides/agents-with-tools).

## A workflow that waits for a person

When an agent alone is not enough, draw the workflow yourself. Nodes are steps, `then` is an arrow,
and a conditional edge picks the next step by looking at the state:

```kotlin
import dev.deeptelar.telar.*

data class Refund(val orderId: String, val amount: Int, val approved: Boolean = false, val status: String = "new")

val refunds = StateGraph<Refund> {
    val check = node("check") { it.copy(status = if (it.amount > 1000) "too large" else "checked") }
    val pay = node("pay") { it.copy(status = if (it.approved) "paid" else "rejected") }
    val decline = node("decline") { it.copy(status = "declined") }

    START then check
    conditionalEdge(check, targets = setOf(pay, decline)) { if (it.status == "checked") pay else decline }
    pay then END
    decline then END
}.compile() // a node nothing leads to, or a target that is not declared, fails here

suspend fun main() {
    // Stop before money moves. The run is saved after every step.
    val config = GraphConfig(threadId = "order-1001", checkpointer = MemoryCheckpointer<Refund>(), interruptBefore = setOf("pay"))

    refunds.invoke(Refund("1001", amount = 250), config)             // runs "check", then waits before "pay"
    val result = refunds.resume(config) { it.copy(approved = true) } // a person said yes
    println(result.state.status)                                     // paid
}
```

This one needs only `telar-core`. With `FileCheckpointer` in place of `MemoryCheckpointer`, the run
waits in a file and continues after a restart:
[Human-in-the-loop](https://deeptelar.github.io/telar/guides/human-in-the-loop). The
[quick start](https://deeptelar.github.io/telar/quick-start) explains a graph line by line.

## Why Telar

- **Your state is a plain `data class`.** Each node returns a `.copy()` of it, so a run is easy to
  test, print and save, and parallel branches cannot overwrite each other by accident.
- **Mistakes in the graph fail in `compile()`.** An unknown node, a node nothing leads to, or two
  parallel nodes with no rule to merge their results are reported before anything runs.
- **Pause anywhere, continue later.** Stop before a node, or call `interrupt` from inside one when
  it finds out it needs a person. The run is saved, and `resume` continues it hours later, in
  another process. `history` and `fork` go back to any earlier step.
- **Every Kotlin platform.** The core depends only on kotlinx-coroutines and runs on the JVM,
  Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, JS and Wasm. Agents, models and checkpoints work there too,
  down to runs saved in the browser's `localStorage`.
- **Coroutines all the way.** Nodes, edges and models are `suspend` functions. Cancellation works
  as you expect, and parallel nodes use structured concurrency.
- **Any model, small surface.** Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama and every server with the API of
  OpenAI, plus any LangChain4j model on the JVM. `ChatModel` is one function, so a model of your
  own, or a fake one in a test, takes a few lines.

Choose Telar when the workflow itself is the hard part: several steps, branches that join, people
who approve, runs that must survive a restart, and state you want to read as ordinary Kotlin. If you
need a large set of ready-made integrations or a stable API today, Koog or LangChain4j are the
safer choice. [Why Telar](https://deeptelar.github.io/telar/why-telar#telar-and-other-libraries) compares Telar with Koog,
LangGraph4j and LangChain4j.

## Installation

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.deeptelar:telar-core:0.1.0-alpha09")      // the graph builder and the engine
    implementation("dev.deeptelar:telar-agent:0.1.0-alpha09")     // chat models, tools and the tool-calling agent
    implementation("dev.deeptelar:telar-anthropic:0.1.0-alpha09") // Claude
    implementation("dev.deeptelar:telar-openai:0.1.0-alpha09")    // OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama and compatible servers
}
```

The artifacts are on Maven Central and need Kotlin 2.x. There are more modules, for saving runs to
files or in a browser, for LangChain4j models and for decision models:
[Installation](https://deeptelar.github.io/telar/installation) lists every module and its targets.

Telar is in alpha. `0.1.0-alpha09` is the latest release. The API may still change before `1.0`; the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md) lists what changes in each version, and the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) lists
what is planned.
