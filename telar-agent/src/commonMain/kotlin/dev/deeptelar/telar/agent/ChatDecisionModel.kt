/**
 * A [DecisionModel] that asks a [ChatModel], so that `choose`, `isYes`, `score` and `decisionEdge`
 * work with the model an app already has: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, or any other.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val decider = ChatDecisionModel(AnthropicChatModel(client, apiKey = key, model = "claude-haiku-5-5"))
 *
 * decisionEdge(from = START, model = decider, instructions = "What does the customer want?", routes = routes, minConfidence = 0.6, fallback = escalate) { it.body }
 * ```
 *
 * Each call to [decide] is one call to the chat model, however many questions the request has. The
 * model is asked how likely it finds each option, and the option it finds most likely is the answer.
 *
 * - **The probabilities are the model's own estimate.** A chat model is not built to measure them,
 *   so they are rougher than those of a decision model such as Jev (`telar-typesafe`), and a
 *   `confidence` of 0.9 is a guess, not a measurement. Try limits such as `minConfidence` on your
 *   own data before you rely on them.
 * - **`confidence` is the lead of the winner**: the probability of the most likely option minus that
 *   of the next one. It is 0 when two options are equally likely, and 1 when the model is sure.
 * - **A small, fast model is usually enough.** Picking an option is easier than writing an answer.
 *
 * A failed call to the chat model, an answer cut off at its output limit, and an answer that is not
 * the JSON it was asked for throw a [DecisionModelException]; for a failed call, the
 * [ChatModelException] is its `cause`.
 *
 * @param model the chat model that decides.
