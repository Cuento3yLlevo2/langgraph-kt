/**
 * An executable graph produced by [StateGraph.compile]. It is immutable and can be shared and run
 * concurrently; each run is isolated by [GraphConfig.threadId].
 *
 * ## Execution model
 *
 * A run advances in steps. In each step all currently active nodes run in parallel on the same
 * input state. When there is more than one, their results are combined: the [Reducer] merges the
 * nodes that returned a whole state, and the updates of the nodes that were added with a `work` and
 * an `update` are then applied one after another, in the order those nodes were added to the graph.
 * The outgoing edges of the nodes then decide which nodes are active in the next step. A branch
 * that routes to [END] simply stops; the run completes when no nodes are active.
 *
 * A node reached by several branches in the same step runs once. If the branches have different
 * lengths, the node runs once for each step in which a branch reaches it.
 *
 * Nodes run in the coroutine context of the caller. If a node fails, the other nodes of that step
 * are cancelled and the failure is rethrown as [NodeExecutionException]. A failure of the reducer or
 * of the condition of an edge is rethrown as [ReducerException] or [EdgeConditionException].
 *
 * ## Pauses
 *
 * A run pauses before or after the nodes that [GraphConfig.interruptBefore] and
 * [GraphConfig.interruptAfter] name, and wherever a node calls [interrupt]. It then ends with
 * [GraphResult.Interrupted], and [resume] continues it. A step in which a node calls [interrupt] is
 * not saved: the state the node passed is, and [resume] runs the nodes of that step again.
 *
 * ## Subgraphs
 *
 * A node added with [StateGraph.subgraph] runs another graph. That graph takes its own steps inside
 * one step of this graph. When one of its nodes calls [interrupt], this run pauses as well, and
 * [resume] continues inside the subgraph, at the node that paused.
 *
 * ## History
 *
 * A checkpointer keeps the checkpoint of every step of a thread. [history] reads them, and [fork]
 * continues from an earlier one on a new thread.
 *
 * ## Failures and retries
 *
 * With a checkpointer, a step is saved once its nodes have run, their results are merged and the
 * next nodes are chosen. A step that fails at any of these points is not saved, so [resume] runs the
 * whole step again, including the nodes of that step that had already finished. Make the side
 * effects of a node safe to repeat.
