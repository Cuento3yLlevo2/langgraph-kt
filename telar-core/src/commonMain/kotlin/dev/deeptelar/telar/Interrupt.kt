/**
 * Pauses the run from inside a node and saves [state]. Use it when a node finds out in the middle of
 * its work that it needs a person, for example to ask a question it only knows at run time.
 *
 * The call never returns. The run ends with [GraphResult.Interrupted], which holds [state], and
 * [CompiledGraph.resume] runs the node again. Put the question into [state] and let `resume` write
 * the answer into the state, so that the node can tell the two runs apart:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val refund = node("refund") { order ->
 *     val amount = refundFor(order)
 *     // Nobody has decided yet: save the question and stop here.
 *     if (order.approved == null) interrupt(order.copy(question = "Refund $amount?"))
 *     if (order.approved) pay(order, amount)
 *     order.copy(question = null)
 * }
 *
 * val paused = graph.invoke(order, config)           // Interrupted, with the question in its state
 * graph.resume(config) { it.copy(approved = true) }  // runs "refund" again, now with the answer
 * ```
 *
 * What to know:
 * - **The node starts again from its first line.** What it did before the call happens a second
 *   time, so call `interrupt` before a side effect, or make the side effect safe to repeat.
 * - **The step is not saved.** When other nodes run in the same step, they are cancelled, and
 *   `resume` runs all of them again with [state] as their input. If two nodes of a step call
 *   `interrupt`, the first one pauses the run and the other one asks after the next `resume`.
 * - **It needs a checkpointer.** Without one the run fails with a [GraphValidationException].
 * - A run that paused here does not pause again before the same nodes because of
 *   [GraphConfig.interruptBefore].
 *
 * Call it from the action of a node, or from the `work` of a node with a `work` and an `update`,
 * with a state of the graph's type. A `try` around the call must not catch `Throwable`, and
 * `runCatching` does: the node would then go on instead of pausing.
 *
 * @throws GraphValidationException when it is not called from a node of a running graph.
