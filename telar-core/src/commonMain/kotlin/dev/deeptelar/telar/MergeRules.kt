/**
 * Builds a [Reducer] from one rule for each property that nodes of the same step may change, in
 * place of a reducer that merges whole states by hand:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * data class Research(
 *     val notes: List<String> = emptyList(),
 *     val status: String = "",
 * )
 *
 * val graph = StateGraph<Research> {
 *     val web = node("web") { it.copy(notes = it.notes + "web") }
 *     val docs = node("docs") { it.copy(notes = it.notes + "docs") }
 *     START then web
 *     START then docs
 * }.compile(
 *     reducer = mergeRules {
 *         append(Research::notes) { copy(notes = it) }       // add what each node added
 *         replace(Research::status) { copy(status = it) }    // take the value of the node that changed it
 *     },
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * A rule names a property and says how to write its merged value back, which for a data class is
 * a `copy`. The reducer compares what each node returned with the state before the step, so a node
 * is written as usual: it returns a whole state with `copy`.
 *
 * A node that changes a property without a rule fails the run with a [ReducerException] instead of
 * losing the change. For that check the state needs `equals`, which a data class has.
 *
 * @throws GraphValidationException if there is no rule, or two rules for the same property.
